1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    *(If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, create one with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

    ```

## Running the Application

This project requires **two concurrent terminal sessions** to run properly.

**1. Start the Tailwind CSS compiler:**
This terminal will watch for changes in your template files (`.html`) and recompile your CSS automatically.

```bash
python manage.py tailwind start
```

**2. Start the Django development server:**
In a **new terminal** (while the first one is still running), start the Django server.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now access the application at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/**. Log in with the superuser credentials you created.
